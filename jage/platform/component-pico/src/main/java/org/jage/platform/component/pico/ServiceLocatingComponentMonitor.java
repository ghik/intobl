/**
 * This is a component monitor that monitors failed attempts to locate a component in the container. When this happens
 * it try to locate this component in components implementing IImplementationProvider interface.
 *
 * Note about performance: DefaultPicoContainer behaves ridiculously and when it retrieves an instance it tries to
 * "pull" it down to the lowest container. That is not a problem, but when doing this, it goes to the top and calls the
 * monitor as many times as there is levels. (It would be worth to override their implementation in future.)
 *
 * This class should not be used unless AGE-137 is fixed otherwise.
